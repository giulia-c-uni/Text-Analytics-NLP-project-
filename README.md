This dataset (FinancialPhraseBank) contains the sentiments for financial news headlines from the perspective of a retail investor.

The aim is to analyze tweets from Kaggle dataset, make our hypothesis and use ML and NLP models to test them, comment the results of the models that we found and apply the best model on “fresh data” to see how it performs.
